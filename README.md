# wonder-lens!
This is our Knight Hacks 2025 project!

The whole premise of this project is that Wonder Lens is a kids' educational app where kids can take a photo of an object, and it will tell them what the object is. The object can also turn into a sticker that the kid can save and go back to at any time. The app is also able to turn the object into a character with googly eyes that tells the user what the object is all about through chatbot prompt.
